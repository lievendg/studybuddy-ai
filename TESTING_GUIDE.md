## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Token Usage:** Exam materials are limited to 3000 characters per material to manage API token usage. Very large exam documents will be truncated.

2. **Material Linking:** The `linked_study_material_id` field is not yet exposed in the UI. This is a future enhancement for associating specific exam materials with specific study materials.

3. **Exam Material Selection:** Currently ALL exam materials are loaded when a study material is selected. Future versions may allow selective loading.

4. **Guest User Persistence:** Guest users' materials are not persisted to the database and will be lost on page reload.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Exam materials not loading
**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- Material type is set to 'exam' in database
- User is authenticated (for persistent storage)

### Issue: Console shows "Found 0 exam materials"
**Check:**
- At least one material with `material_type = 'exam'` exists
- User ID matches the materials' `user_id`
- Materials are not soft-deleted

### Issue: Claude API not receiving exam materials
**Check:**
- Console log shows `ðŸ“š Using X exam material(s) for context`
- `appState.examMaterials` is not empty (check React DevTools)
- API call includes examMaterials parameter

### Issue: Migration script fails
**Check:**
- Column already exists (re-run safe with IF NOT EXISTS)
- Permissions are correct
- Syntax is valid for PostgreSQL

---

## Developer Console Commands

Useful commands for debugging:

```javascript
// Check current app state
console.log(window.appState);

// Check loaded exam materials
console.log(window.appState?.examMaterials);

// Force reload materials (in React DevTools)
// Find MaterialLibrary component and trigger loadMaterials()

// Check Supabase connection
// Go to Network tab, filter by "supabase"
```

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Document Findings:** Note any issues in the test results table
2. **Report Bugs:** Create issues for any failing tests
3. **Performance Testing:** Monitor API token usage with multiple exam materials
4. **User Acceptance Testing:** Have actual users test the workflow
5. **Production Deployment:** Plan rollout strategy including database migration
