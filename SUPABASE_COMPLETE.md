# Supabase Integration - COMPLETE! 🎉

## What We've Accomplished

Your StudyBuddy AI app now has **full Supabase integration** with:

✅ **User Authentication** - Sign up, sign in, sign out
✅ **Database Storage** - 6-table schema for all data
✅ **PDF Storage** - Files stored in Supabase Storage
✅ **Material Library** - Browse and manage saved PDFs
✅ **Progress Persistence** - Your learning tracked across sessions
✅ **Multi-Device Sync** - Access your materials anywhere

---

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication Flow
- Users can **sign up** or **sign in** using email/password
- Auth state persists across sessions (stay logged in)
- User profile dropdown shows email and sign out option
- **Works without auth too!** App runs in local-only mode if not signed in

### 2. Material Management
When **signed in**:
- Upload PDF → Saves to Supabase Storage **AND** database
- Click "Library" → See all your saved materials
- Select material → Loads instantly from database
- Delete material → Removes from both storage and database

When **not signed in**:
- Upload PDF → Works locally (no persistence)
- Study session lasts until page refresh
- Can sign in anytime to start saving

### 3. Data Persistence
The database tracks:
- **Study Materials** - Your uploaded PDFs and metadata
- **Study Sessions** - When you studied and what mode
- **Progress Tracking** - Questions answered, accuracy, topics
- **Conversation History** - Your chat with Claude (coming soon)
- **Exam Configurations** - Exam-specific settings (coming soon)
- **Quiz Results** - Detailed quiz performance (coming soon)

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema SQL

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor** in the sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Open the file: `supabase-schema.sql`
5. Copy ALL the SQL and paste into Supabase
6. Click **Run** (Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
7. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

This creates all 6 tables with proper security policies.

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click **Create a new bucket**
3. Set:
   - **Name**: `study-materials`
   - **Public**: OFF (private)
   - **File size limit**: 50 MB
4. Click **Create bucket**

### Step 3: Set Storage Policies

1. Click on the `study-materials` bucket
2. Go to **Policies** tab
3. Create 4 policies by clicking **New Policy** → **For full customization** for each:

**Policy 1 - Allow uploads (INSERT):**
- **Policy name**: `Allow authenticated uploads`
- **Allowed operation**: ✅ INSERT
- **Policy definition**:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'study-materials' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated')
```

**Policy 2 - Allow reads (SELECT):**
- **Policy name**: `Allow users to read own files`
- **Allowed operation**: ✅ SELECT
- **Policy definition**:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'study-materials' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text)
```

**Policy 3 - Allow updates (UPDATE):**
- **Policy name**: `Allow users to update own files`
- **Allowed operation**: ✅ UPDATE
- **Policy definition**:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'study-materials' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text)
```

**Policy 4 - Allow deletes (DELETE):**
- **Policy name**: `Allow users to delete own files`
- **Allowed operation**: ✅ DELETE
- **Policy definition**:
```sql
(bucket_id = 'study-materials' AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text)
```

**Important**: For each policy, make sure to:
1. Give it a descriptive name
2. Check ONLY the relevant operation (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE)
3. Paste the policy definition exactly as shown
4. Click "Review" then "Save policy"

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Your app is already running at: **http://localhost:3000**
2. Click "Sign In" in top right
3. Create a new account
4. Check your email to verify (Supabase sends confirmation)
5. Upload a PDF textbook
6. It will save to both storage and database!
7. Try signing out and back in - your material persists!

- Check you're signed in

### "Table does not exist" errors
- **Fix**: Run the SQL schema in Supabase (Step 1)
- Check SQL Editor for any error messages
- Verify all 6 tables were created

### Authentication not working
- **Fix**: Check Supabase → Authentication → Providers
- Email should be enabled
- Check .env has correct credentials
- Restart dev server after .env changes

### Can't see my materials
- **Fix**: Make sure you're signed in with same account
- Check Supabase → Table Editor → study_materials
- Verify RLS policies were created
